title: Introduction -- Welcome to CSCI 1301!
---

For this first lab, we would like to discuss three important topics for you to succeed in this class.

#. [How to access the material and navigate our resources](#navigating-our-resources-1),
#. [What to read first](#what-to-read-first-1),
#. [How to get help](#how-to-get-help-1).

As you may have noted, the list of topics was already included a first time below the title: we generally try to include a table of contents and summary, along with numerous links, to make our guides easy to navigate.

<!--
Action:
~ _Before you get started with this lab_, please complete the short survey we have designed for you on [LMS](https://lms.augusta.edu/) (formerly D2L), on the CSCI 1301 page, under Assessments, then Surveys. This brief series of questions are **anonymous** and **not graded**: they are purely for statistical purposes, and to make sure that this class suits your need. You can read more [about why we survey our students](../../survey.html).

# Navigating our Resources

We strive to provide to our students all the material they will need to succeed in one place, at <https://csci-1301.github.io/>.
On this website, you will find

- ["The book"](https://csci-1301.github.io/book.html), which contains the lecture notes to cover one semester, and is available [in `pdf`](https://csci-1301.github.io/book.pdf) (for printing, typically) and [in `odt`](https://csci-1301.github.io/book.odt)/[`docx`](https://csci-1301.github.io/book.docx) (for editing, typically; `docx` included for Microsoft Word compatibility). Along with [the `html` version](https://csci-1301.github.io/book.html) (i.e., the website), this gives four convenient ways of accessing the content of this course.
- [Slides](https://csci-1301.github.io/slides.html) accompanying the lecture notes (in `pptx` and `pdf`).
- [The labs](https://csci-1301.github.io/labs/), which are (most of the time) tied to particular lectures, and contains hands-on practice exercise as well as instructions on how to use computers to complete this class.
- Along with [other useful documents](https://csci-1301.github.io/#other-documents) about this class or studying at [our school](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/) in particular.

The main purpose of this first lab is to help you navigating those resources.
We want this reading to be pro-active, so we will include questions and actions like the ones below every now and then to help you be engaged with the material.

Question:
~  We used five different file formats in the text above you may not be familiar with. Along with _markdown_ (`md`), that's six: can you make sure you know them all and know their purposes? Looking them up [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_formats) and reading the first paragraph of each of their pages can be a good way of getting started!

Action:
~ On the `html` version of our documents (so, on the website), you will always find [in the footer](#footer) links to the `pdf`, `odt`, and `docx` versions of the document you are currently reading.
Download them by clicking on the "↓ pdf", "↓ odt", and "↓ docx" links, then make sure you can open them all.
You should realize that their content is identical to the page you are currently reading!^[Even this sentence will be displayed, even if it makes no sense to discuss the links in the footer of a `pdf` file, which does not have them!]

You may also have seen the [Source code](https://github.com/csci-1301/csci-1301.github.io) and [About](../../about.html) links in the footer: the first one will give you access to the "frame" we are using to construct all of these resources, and the second contains information about the authors, copyrights and tools used to construct this website.
Even if you do not need to understand the source code and details of the implementation of these resources (which uses, as you may have guessed … markdown!), being curious about them may be extremely useful for the sake of learning, if you want to become an [Undergraduate Course Assistant (UCA)](https://csci-1301.github.io/uca.html), are interested in contributing to open-source project, or simply wonder how the magic is done!

# What to Read First

Your instructor(s) will be your primary guide when it comes to the order in which you need to read the material hosted here.
However, you should feel free to explore our [other useful documents](https://csci-1301.github.io/#other-documents) that contain information you may be interested in fairly early in the semester (like…today!).
Typically, the [Installing Software](../../software_install.html) page should probably be one of the first documents you read: it explains in detail how to set-up your computer to be able to execute, compile and study the code we will be discussing in class and lab, and how to access and use the computer labs.

Action:
~ Reading instructions is not always easy. You should try to always understand what is crucial, what is important, and what is optional.
Although you may have overlooked that subtlety, the previous paragraph actually meant

> _Go read [Installing Software](../../software_install.html) as soon as possible, you want to be ready for the next lab!_

This is particularly true for labs asking for you to set things up: there is little to gain in postponing that step, and if you are facing difficulties, it is better [to ask](#how-to-get-help-1) earlier rather than later!

Some of the resources on this website are still in flux: the instructors are working hard to construct the material from scratch, and we are sorry if at times you feel that you are going through dry runs.
On the flip side, remember that you did not have to buy a textbook, and that these resources will be tailored for your use and course of study here at Augusta University: among many other specificities, like using C#, we are making sure that security and other cyber-related issues are regularly discussed!

You should also remember that the internet is (also!) a wonderful place where many useful resources are shared.
For instance, [this guide on open source](https://opensource.guide/) is an excellent place to understand what open source is and why it matters.
Our resources are supported by Affordable Learning Georgia, which strives to share good, accessible and free (as in "free coffee" _and_ as in "free speech") Open Educational Resources (OER) to students in Georgia: [reading their "About"](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/about/about_us) page may help you understand the importance and benefits of developing resources here, for you!

Question:
~ What exactly is implied by "free" as in "free coffee" _and_ as in "free speech"? Try to understand what "[free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)" means: is it like coffee (some people say "beer") or like speech? Are the resources presented here free as in coffee, as in speech, or both? And what about your computer's operating system? Your media player? Try to look at the licenses of some of the software you use on a daily basis. You may realize that some important software products are actually open source, and host their code on e.g., github!

# How to Get Help

This may be the most important aspect of this lab: understanding when to get help, and how to obtain it, is critical in succeeding in your studies (be it in this class or other classes!).
Your instructor(s) should be your first point of contact for any question regarding the content of this class, but many other resources are available, through the University, for this class, or through clubs.
Also, understanding _how_ to ask is extremely important.

All of that is discussed [on this page](../../getting_help.html).

Action:
~ Read the [How to get Help](../../getting_help.html) page.

Action:
~ _If you feel like it_, create an account on [Github](https://github.com/login) and [leave a comment](#how-is-this-page)! We'll be happy to read from you!

Action:
~ You may have noticed that multiple links point to <https://www.wikihow.com/>. Can you check if _the content_ and _the software platform_ of wikihow are free (as in coffee or speech)?

<!--
Again, your instructor(s) should be your first point of contact.
Make sure you have their email address, and understand their preferred means of communication: is it through [LMS](https://lms.augusta.edu/) (formerly D2L), [Teams](https://www.augusta.edu/its/microsoftteams.php), their office hours?

Secondly, if your class has Undergraduate Course Assistant(s) (UCA), they may be the right person(s) to ask all kind of questions: they went through CSCI 1301 and have been selected based on their capacities, grades, interest and skills, so they will be able at the same time to relate to your struggle and describe the program better than anyone else!

There is also a way of reaching _all the instructors of CSCI 1301_ at once, and it is by commenting on this site's pages, as we explain below.
