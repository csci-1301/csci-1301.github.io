## Purpose

This website contains all the resources to learn the principles of computer programming using C#.
It is used in the delivery of CSCI 1301 - Principles of Computer Programming I and CSCI 1302 - Principles of Computer Programming II in the [Bachelor of Science in Computer Science](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/bs-cs.php) at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu), and contains practical guides and additional resources for students and instructors.

## Tools

We strive to prioritize open-source software when possible, and occasionally contribute to them.

### Software

This website uses different technologies.

- The markdown source code is converted to (a slightly different) `md` `pdf`, `odt` and `docx` thanks to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [pandoc-include](https://github.com/DCsunset/pandoc-include).
- The `pdf` format is compiled using [XeLaTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/).
- The source code is highlighted thanks to [Pygments](https://pygments.org/).
- The website is powered by [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

More details on the tools we use can be found in [our user guide](user_guide.html#repository-maintenance).

### Fonts

We use the [URW Gothic](https://fontesk.com/gothic-typeface/) and [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) (inspired by the [DejaVu](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) font) fonts.
Those fonts have been specially selected for their legibility and [lower impact on environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Gothic#Printer_ink_usage).

### Services

The source code and the website are graciously hosted and built by [github](https://github.com/).
